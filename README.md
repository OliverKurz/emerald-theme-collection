Installation Walkthrough
------------------------
1. Install a Linux distribution that supports a Desktop Environment which Compiz can be run on.

2. Install Compiz and Emerald (I recommend checking out the Compiz Reloaded project).

3. cd into the directory you cloned or copied this archive into and type the following commands:

```
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

4. Run Compiz and run Emerald as the Window Decoration.

5. Open the Emerald Theme Manager and there should be system themes with the tag _Emerald in their title. I recommend unchecking all of the options in Emerald Settings section in the Emerald Theme Manager, as well as disabling the button fade and pulse settings. Should you choose to uninstall one or all of these Emerald themes, for now this can be done by cding into the /usr/share/Emerald/Themes directory and searching with the tag _Emerald.
